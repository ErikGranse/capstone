<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Left ventricular pacemaker lead technology was evolving 
and different types of pacemaker lead were successively used. Sensing was 
modified according with this evolution, starting with initial experience that 
utilized epicardical left ventricular pacing through leads positioned at limited 
thoracotomy <SPAN class=SuperSub>[1]</SPAN>. In other experiences a lead 
specifically designed for left atrial pacing via CS was used. This tine-free 
lead has a bipolar, coaxial polyurethane-coating with a 5.8 mm non-steroid 
eluting canted electrode tip <SPAN class=SuperSub>[2-3]</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Another step was a tine-free unipolar polyurethane 
coated coaxial lead designed specifically for left ventricular pacing via the 
coronary sinus (figure 1). To aid with CS cannulation, a specifically designed 
guiding sheath was employed. This sheath is pre-shaped to facilitate CS entry, 
thus allowing pacemaker lead placement through its lumen. After pacemaker lead 
positioning the sheath can be pulled back and split externally along its entire 
length to allow separation from the underlying pacing lead. <SPAN 
class=SuperSub>[4,5]</SPAN>. In addition the lead used was of a novel design 
with a terminal adaptation allowing lead passage over a pre-positioned guidewire 
(side-wire pacing leads) <SPAN class=SuperSub>[6]</SPAN>.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Although at the present time, most of the pacemakers 
have a three lumen head (with different type of sensing functions) during 
initially experiences standard DDDR devices were employed where the left 
ventricular lead was connected to the atrial port of the device and the right 
ventricular lead was connected to the ventricular port. Setting the AV delay to 
its minimum near simultaneous biventricular capture could be achieved. Unipolar 
or bipolar pacing and sensing could be used dependent on the pacemaker lead 
utilized. <SPAN class=SuperSub>[9]</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>In the PATH-CHF study <SPAN 
class=SuperSub>[10,11]</SPAN> 2 DDDR pacemakers were implanted in all patients. 
The first pacemaker was implanted and connected to a right atrial bipolar lead 
and to a unipolar right ventricular lead. The second pacemaker was implanted and 
connected to a second bipolar right atrial lead and a unipolar ventricular 
epicardial lead. Atrial sequential biventricular pacing could be initiated by 
setting one pulse generator to DDD mode while the other was programmed in VVT 
mode. Sensing could be adjusted according to each individual lead.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Another step was the use of a Y connection for right 
and left ventricular leads in a single DDDR pacemaker, with simultaneous pacing 
and sensing in both ventricles.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Actually, a three chamber pacemakers with three lumen 
head are used and sensing vary from different models: all of them have bipolar 
(programmable to unipolar if required) sensing in right atrium; but some of them 
have unipolar sensing at the left ventricle independent of the RV sensing 
(usually bipolar); some have bipolar sensing between the RV and the LV tip lead 
and some of them RV-only sensing, as shown in table I. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN 
class=ConfTextoN>SENSITIVITY<BR>Overview</SPAN><BR>If a cardiac signal of 
sufficient amplitude and morphology occurs during the sensing period, the 
pacemaker output will be inhibited or triggered depending upon the mode 
selected. The sensing circuit is specially designed to reject extraneous signals 
while sensing P waves or R waves.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Sensitivity determines the minimum intracardiac signal 
that the device can detect when intrinsic atrial or ventricular events occur. 
The higher the mV value, the lower the sensitivity. When senstivity is 
programmed to a very sensitive setting (a low value) the device may detect 
signals unrelated to cardiac depolarization (oversensing: eg. sensing of 
myopotencials). When sensitivity is programmed to a less sensitive setting (a 
higher value) the device may not detect the cardiac depolarization signal 
(undersensing). Sensitivity must be programmed to a value that prevents sensing 
of extraneous signals, but ensures accurate sensing of intrinsic cardiac 
signals. Intrinsic atrial signals are typically smaller than ventricular 
signals, so lower sensitivity settings are typically programmed for the 
atrium.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>Left ventricular signals are typically smaller than 
right ventricular signals. In some devices this is an independent value but in 
others, the measurement is a combination of signals from the left and right 
ventricles and ventricular signal may be attenuated (reduced). So, sensitivity 
settings should be programmed according this situation. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Whether selecting sensing parameters at implant or 
verifying sensing at follow-up, the same considerations apply:</SPAN></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>a. Select sensing polarity for leads<BR>b. Determine 
  sensing thresholds<BR>c. Select appropriate sensitivity 
settings</SPAN></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>A. Selecting Sensing 
Polarity</SPAN><BR>Atrial and ventricular sensing polarities can be programmed 
for each chamber when used with bipolar leads.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN><I>Bipolar Sensing 
Polarity</I></SPAN> - The lead tip and the lead ring electrode are the poles of 
the sensing circuit. Because bipolar sensing is more localized, it reduces the 
likelihood of sensing myopotentials and electromagnetic interference. It may 
also permit sensitivity to be programmed to a more sensitive setting.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN><I>Unipolar Sensing 
Polarity</I></SPAN> - The lead tip (occasionally the lead ring) and the 
noninsulated stimulator case are the sensing electrodes. Unipolar sensing may 
allow sensing of smaller intrinsic signals than does bipolar sensing and 
therefore, can be selected when intrinsic cardiac signals are difficult to 
detect with bipolar sensing. Oversensing due to myopotentials is more common 
with unipolar sensing than with bipolar sensing.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN><I>Bipolar RV/LV Sensing 
Polarity</I></SPAN> - In the LV-1 lead, the electrical activity will be sensed 
between the lead tip and the right ventricular lead ring. The distance the 
stimulus travels between the lead tip and the right ventricular lead ring will 
be affected by the size of the heart. The greater the distance, the more prone 
the device is to sensing myopotentials.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN><I>Bipolar Sensing Polarity 
Confirmation</I></SPAN><BR>Before programming from unipolar to bipolar sensing, 
some of the programmer verifies the presence of a functioning bipolar lead by 
testing impedance for the lead. Testing is done under magnet operation for four 
seconds at an Amplitude of 5.0 V and a Pulse<BR>Width of 1.0 ms if the permanent 
settings are at or below this level.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>If permanent settings are above these values, the 
measurement will be made at the permanent settings.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>If bipolar lead impedance is between 200 ohms and 3000 
ohms, a bipolar lead is assumed to be present.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>If bipolar lead impedance is outside this range, a 
unipolar lead is assumed to be present. The programmer warns that the test 
failed, and sensing polarity remains set to unipolar.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>This interlock feature may be overridden and lead 
sensing polarity forced to bipolar.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Impedance for the ventricular two-lead system is 
measured across the parallel combination of both leads in most devices. However, 
if pairing a ventricular lead with a polished platinum tip electrode with a lead 
with a tip electrode of a different material may create a source impedance 
mismatch that could adversely affect sensing.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>B. Determining Sensing 
Threshold(s) at Implant</SPAN><BR>Before connecting a lead, implanting physician 
should measure the sensing potentials in the unipolar and the bipolar 
configurations. Adequate intracardiac signal should be present in both 
configurations to ensure proper sensing in either.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN><I>Verifying Sensing 
Threshold(s) at Follow-up</I></SPAN><BR>Intracardiac signal amplitudes decrease 
during the lead maturation process. Most programmers provide an automatic 
sensitivity test that allows the follow-up clinician to </SPAN><SPAN 
class=ConfTexto>verify a patient's sensitivity settings. The automatic test 
provides for atrial or ventricular monitoring. The test provides the sensitivity 
setting just above and below the point at which P waves or R waves are 
sensed.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>The cardiac signal presented to the stimulator by the 
ventricular two-lead system is a composite signal from the parallel combination 
of both ventricular leads in some devices. The sensing test treats this signal 
as a single input with a measurable amplitude that can be used to determine an 
appropriate setting for ventricular sensitivity. Usually this signal may be 
attenuated (reduced) in the biventricular configuration. Conducting the Sensing 
test for the ventricular two-lead system does not require any special 
considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>C. Selecting Sensitivity 
Settings</SPAN><BR>Atrial and ventricular sensitivity are independently 
programmable. In general, a 2:1 to 3:1 sensitivity safety margin (threshold 
sensitivity value divided by 2 or 3) is adequate for newly implanted or chronic 
leads. For example, an atrial sensitivity of 1.0 mV should be satisfactory for 
intrinsic atrial signals between 2.0 mV and 3.0 mV.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Ventricular sensitivities 1.0 mV or 1.4 mV with wide 
atrial pulse widths or high atrial amplitudes may result in Ventricular Safety 
Pacing (if On) with some lead systems at high sensor-driven pacing rates. 
Reprogramming Ventricular Sensitivity to a less sensitive setting (higher 
numerical value) is one option under such circumstances. Other options include 
programming a longer Ventricular Blanking Period.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Excessively sensitive (low) settings can cause some or 
all of the following problems:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>Refractory 
Periods</SPAN><BR>Pacemakers with a sensing mode incorporate a programmable 
parameter known as the refractory period</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>The refractory period is the interval following a paced 
or sensed event during which the device is not inhibited or triggered by 
detected electrical activity. The purpose of the refractory period is to prevent 
resetting of the pacemaker timing cycles in response to known but physiological 
inappropriate electrical signals.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Pacing refractory periods prevent certain pacing timing

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>In some cases, the programmer will automatically select 
refractory periods suitable to the programmed parameters.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>In the AAT, AAI and AAIR modes, the <SPAN 
class=ConfTextoN>Atrial Refractory Period (ARP)</SPAN> is defined as the time 
period after an atrial event, either paced or sensed, when activity in the 
atrium does not inhibit or trigger an atrial stimulus. It prevents inappropriate 
atrial inhibition due to sensed far-field R-waves or electrical noise. The first 
portion of the ARP is a blanking period that disables atrial sensing.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>Ventricular Refractory Period 
(VRP)</SPAN>: Is defined as the time period following a ventricular event, 
either paced or sensed, when sensed electrical activity in the ventricles does 
not inhibit the device. This parameter is available in any mode in which 
ventricular sensing is enabled and the interval is programmable in all 
biventricular devices but not in all ICD-biventricular devices.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Use a long ventricular refractory period shortens the 
ventricular sensing window. Programming the ventricular refractory period to a 
value greater than PVARP can lead to competitive pacing.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>In dual chamber pacing modes, the Post-Ventricular 
Atrial Refractory Period (PVARP) controls how the device responds to retrograde 
P-waves. It is defined as the time period after a ventricular event, either

nor trigger a ventricular stimulus. It is designed to prevent the atrial channel 
from sensing the ventricular pacing pulse, the far-field R-waves or retrograde P

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>The blanking periods following paced events are longer

pulse generator´s noise response functions designed to protect the patient 
against inappropriate inhibition of the pulse generator due to detected rapid 
electrical interference signals or "noise". Noise rejection works through the 
programmable refractory period, that is composed of two segments: the absolute 
refractory period and the relative refractory period. In the absolute refractory 
period no signals will be detected. Any electrical signals occurring within the 
relative refractory period will initiate a noise-sampling window beginning at 
the point where the noise signal was detected.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>Hence, in the presence of continuously detected 
electrical noise, the refractory period will be repeatedly reset until the

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>ADVANTAGES, PITFALLS AND 
SOLUTIONS </SPAN><BR>Sensing in RV only or in both ventricles, together or 
separately, during pacing or in sinus rhythm should modify the response of the 
system. The differences of these situation are explained as well as double 
counting of T waves and farfield noise.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>UNDER DETECTION DUE TO 
SPONTANEOUS VENTRICULAR BEATS IN RV-ONLY SENSING:</SPAN> A system that senses 
RV-only do not see any beat (ectopic) that is originated in the Left Ventricle 
and may stimulate it over the refractory period. On the other hand, any 
intrinsic ventricular action inhibits delivery of a ventricular pulse in the DDD 
mode. The ventricles are not brought into synchrony with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>OVER DETECTION DUE TO LV+RV 
SENSING:</SPAN> A system that senses both the RV and LV leads in the presence of 
a QRS&gt;130 msec may double sense a sinus rhythm contraction. This situation is 
true only when the patient's P-R interval is shorter than the programmed AV 
delay and/or there are no pacing beats at the ventricles. A similar situation 
could be seen if the sensing delay of both ventricles is greater than the 
ventricular refractory period (programmable in ICD but not in all the 
pacemakers). <BR>However, in both cases there are no RCT due to the fact that 
there are no pacing beats.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>SOLUTIONS:</SPAN> Although 
optimal performance of biventricular devices' sensing has yet to be determined, 
some companies modified the sensing system to avoid these problems and other 
introduced de DDT(R)/V mode and the LV protection period.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto>The DDT(R)/V mode has been specially designed to ensure 
biventricular synchronization. Is a permanent rate-adaptative pacing mode that 
represents a combination of the DDDR mode with a VVT mode. In DDT(R)/V mode, the 
pacemaker triggers a ventricular pace when the AV interval completes without 
sensing an intrinsic ventricular event. Furthermore, intrinsic right and left 
ventricular senses trigger a biventricular pace within 10 msec. So, the 
pacemaker response in the ventricular channel corresponds to a VVT mode, and its 
atrial or its AV-sequential behavior is analogous to a DDD mode. The clinical 
benefit of the DDT(R)/V mode is based on the ability to resynchronize both 
ventricles even during ventricular sense events.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN class=ConfTexto><SPAN class=ConfTextoN>LEFT VENTRICULAR PROTECTION 
PERIOD:</SPAN> Sensing on the LV could avoid a pace over the refractory period 
after a PVC's. The following example could help to understand the case: in the 
presence of a PVC's originated in the lateral wall of the LV, if the device 
senses only the RV will not see the ectopic beat and will pace the RV and then 
the LV (that will be during the vulnerable period). To avoid this situation, 
some devices sense the LV and let you to program the refractory period during 
which there are no chance to stimulate the LV if there was a sensing 
activity.</SPAN></P>
