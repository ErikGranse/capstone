# ICS-499 Capstone

As the title suggests, this was a college Capstone project, written _many_ years ago.

It's pretty scattered, as we were using a Yahoo group to manage all source and artifacts (source control not being a topic covered in the CS major at the time), and the actual code is also rough-and-ready, although not as bad as I was expecting.

This was pulled into git solely because Yahoo Groups will be deleting all content in December 2019, which caused me to check to see if I could still get into that old group.

Many password resets and Yahoo headaches later, here it is for your edification.
